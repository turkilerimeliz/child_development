## üõ†Ô∏è Dataset and Methodology

- **Data:** The analysis is based on micro-level data,  T√ºrkiye Child Survey Micro Data Set, collected in 2022.   
- **Methodology:** The study applies econometric techniques to explore the relationship between women‚Äôs maternal work and early childhood development, controlling for various socioeconomic factors. Advanced econometric techniques‚Äîincluding OLS and logit regressions, multiple hypothesis testing, and sample reweighting‚Äîwere employed to ensure robust and credible empirical analysis.

## üìÇ Input Data Sources

### T√ºrkiye Child Survey Micro Data Set, 2022

Access to the following datasets can be requested from TURKSTAT: [https://tuik_mikro_veri](https://www.tuik.gov.tr/Kurumsal/Mikro_Veri)  
TURKSTAT provides the original data folder in CSV format. For analysis purposes, the files should be converted to Stata (.dta) format, ensuring that variable names are in lowercase.

- `TCS_Household_Microdata.dta` ‚Äì Household characteristics
- `TCS_Individual_0-17_Microdata.dta` ‚Äì Child questionnaire 
- `TCS_Individuallist_Microdata.dta` ‚Äì Household roster

## üóÇÔ∏è Folder Structure

To replicate the analysis, please ensure the following folder structure is in place. Microdata obtained from TURKSTAT should be placed in the `datain` folder. The provided do-files should be copied into the `do` folder. The folders `dataout`, `figures`, and `results` can remain empty initially, as they will be populated by the output generated during execution of the do-file.
